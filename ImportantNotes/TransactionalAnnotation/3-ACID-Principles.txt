🔑 ACID Principles Explained
1. Atomicity → All or Nothing
Meaning: A transaction is indivisible. Either every step succeeds, or none of them happen.

Example: You transfer ₹1000 from Account A to Account B.

Debit A by ₹1000 ✅

Credit B by ₹1000 ✅

If credit fails, debit is also rolled back.

Result: Either both succeed or both fail — no half-done transfer.

2. Consistency → Valid State Before and After
Meaning: Transactions must leave the database in a consistent state, following all rules.

Example:

Rule: Total money in the system must remain constant.

Before transfer: A = ₹5000, B = ₹2000 → Total = ₹7000

After transfer: A = ₹4000, B = ₹3000 → Total = ₹7000

Consistency ensures rules are respected.

3. Isolation → No Interference
Meaning: Transactions run independently, as if they are alone.

Example:

Two people transfer money at the same time.

Isolation ensures one transaction doesn’t “see” the partial work of the other.

Without isolation, both might read the same balance and cause overdrafts.

4. Durability → Permanent Once Committed
Meaning: Once a transaction is committed, it survives crashes, power failures, etc.

Example:

You transfer ₹1000 and get a “Success” message.

Even if the server crashes right after, the database keeps the updated balances.

Durability ensures committed changes are not lost.

🏦 Putting It All Together (Bank Example)
Imagine transferring money:

Atomicity → Debit + Credit happen together.

Consistency → Total money remains the same.

Isolation → Other transfers don’t mess with yours.

Durability → Once done, it’s permanent.
